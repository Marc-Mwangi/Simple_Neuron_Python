# Simple_Neuron_Python
A simple presentation of a logic neoron in python that is the fundational base for building a neural network

# Definition
# What is a neuron?
This is the basic unit of a neural network. Simply put a neural takes inputs (could be multiple) , does computations on them and returns one output. 

# Diving Deeper into the concept

Considering multiple inputs a neuron weights each input. In real life this can applied depending on the confidence in each input based on gut or research. Preferably research. This two inputs are computed together accounting for a bias(if bias is present). A positive number would represent positive bias while a negative number will represent negative bias.

# The activation function

This final result from the computation is run through an activation function. The activation function normally used is the sigmoid which would return a number between 0 and 1 despite the input. Think of it as shrinking the scale of -infinity to infinity to something scalable to provide more efficiency.
